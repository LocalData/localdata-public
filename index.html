            mobile or paper-based surveys.

            <p>We're building tools that let you collect information about your
              neighborhood better and faster.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Efficiency: Collect information on buildings, streets and places using a smartphone</li>
              <li>Accessibility: Use a scannable paper survey instead of a mobile phone for hand-written information
                  data collectors of all ages and technical ability can use.</li>
              <li>Visualization: Easily export the results to Excel &mdash; or watch them
                  appear in real time online.</li>

            <p>Community groups organize to collect information about housing
              condition, vacancy, blight, urban gardens, and more. This process
              is time-consuming and frustrating: it can take months to develop
              the questions and process hundreds of pages of results.</p>

              <p> We're working with community organizations &amp; the City of Detroit to build out this app. We'll be testing it out Summer 
                  2012.Community groups: How can we make this tool best serve your needs? Let us know how &amp; why you're interested,
                  and we'll do our best to help you out.</p>
                  <p>Developers: We'd love your help! Our <a href="http://github.com/codeforamerica/nsb-mobile">code is on GitHub</a> and our <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/514709">stories are in Pivotal Tracker</a>.
                      The mobile app is built on HTML5, Javascript, and Leaflet. 
                      Server-side data processing is built on NodeJS, Flask, and PostGIS.
                      We're always looking for ways to make the project leaner,
                      faster, and more robust.</p>
