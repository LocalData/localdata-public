                <li>Ask the same questions on a paper survey that's
                  easy to scan, so answers are transcribed automatically</li>
                <li>Easily export the results to Excel &mdash; or watch them

            <p>Groups organize to collect information about housing
              condition, vacancy, blight, urban gardens, and more. This process
              is time-consuming and frustrating: it can take months to develop
              the questions and process hundreds of pages of results.</p>
              
            <p>The On your Block project will help improve efficiency, data quality,
              and user experience. And it will keep the accessibility, usefulness, 
              and empowering quality of traditional paper-only surveys.</p>
