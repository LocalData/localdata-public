					<h2 class="section-header">Why is data important to cities and communities?</h2>
					<p>Across the country, different kinds of groups (cites, nonprofits, universities) already collect place-based data. These groups add or update information on a variety of indicators -- anything from recreational and environmental assets like parks, gardens and playgrounds, to the conditions of vacant lots and abandoned buildings, to where local businesses and institutions are. This information is used to support advocacy campaigns, fundraising, and political support of ideas or community interests.</p>
					<p>Data also helps with a critical need communities have to simply be informed! Media, governments, and citizens can consume crowd-collected data to visualize the important components of where they live.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2 class="section-header">What does the platform change?</h2>
					<p>LocalData helps residents, government agencies, and nonprofits rapidly gather accurate and useful neighborhood-level data. It also bridges the gap between technically useful data-oriented tools and simple, friendly consumer tools.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2 class="section-header">Has it been used anywhere already?</h2>
					<p>Two groups in Detroit have piloted LocalData in its beta development stage. A graduate urban planning class at Wayne State University used the toolkit in partnership with the City of Detroit as part of a capstone project to study commercial corridors. Over a six-week period, the class successfully collected data on over 9,000 commercial properties and created a citywide <a href="http://clasweb.clas.wayne.edu/DUSP/CapstoneProjects" target="_blank">study</a>. Currently, a smaller community development corporation in Detroit is piloting LocalData to survey housing conditions and the location of vacant property.</p>
					<p>In both of these cases, LocalData has contributed to the efficiency and scale at which place-based information can be collected. We strive to change the emphasis from sorting, cleaning, and transcription to actually using collected data to make real-world impacts.</p>

					<h2 class="section-header">Who are your funders?</h2>
					<p>We created this project as part of the Code for America fellowship program.</p>

					<h2 class="section-header">How do disempowered communities benefit from high-tech tools like LocalData?</h2>
					<p>We work to make LocalData a truly accessible tool for users of all ages, ability and digital access. In our early work in Detroit, we observed that many surveyors lacked smartphones or were more comfortable with pen and paper. Our paper-based survey tool addresses this need without sacrificing design or efficiency. Contextual maps provide advantages to the user over traditional survey sheets, and simple fill-in-the-bubble questions allow groups to efficiently scan the forms and incorporate the data.</p>
